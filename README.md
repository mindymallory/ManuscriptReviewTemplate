# Manuscript Review Template

This is my template for preparing manuscript reviews. There are two documents. 

1. Review
2. Blind Review

Review contains my name, and Blind Review does not. Review is when I prepare a review for students and colleagues, while Blind Review is for Reviewing journal articles.
